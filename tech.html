				<h3>Galaga Remake</h3>
					<p> 
						Using C++ and SDL2, a low-level media development library, I recreated the classis arcade game, Galaga.  I learned the basics of game development like collision detection, frame capping, rendering, audio,etc.Combining some interest of mine, I'm currently developing a reinforcemet learning AI agent to play my game.

					<h3>Pokedex</h3>
					<p>
						What originally served as my application project for my first internship at NinjaOne turned into a fun fully fledge mobile application. I had experience doing mobile development... however it was in flutter. So after submitting my MVP for my application, I took the time to fully build out my project and create a Pokedex! Pulling information from PokeAPI, I learned the basics of iOS development using the native development tools (swift, SwiftUI, objectiveC) and MVVM architecture.
